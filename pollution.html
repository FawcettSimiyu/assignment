                    Global pollutants have global impacts.They mainly include CO2, which is a pollutant linked to the massive use of fossil fuels by transport and industry. CO2 is a paradoxical pollutant, which will have direct beneficial effects on plant growth via its essential role in photosynthesis. But at the same time, it has indirect harmful effects on plants through the greenhouse effect and the resulting climate disturbances.
                    A variety of air pollutants have known or suspected harmful effects on human health and the environment. In most areas of Europe, these pollutants are principally the products of combustion from space heating, power generation or from motor vehicle traffic. Pollutants from these sources may not only prove a problem in the immediate vicinity of these sources but can travel long distances.
                    The conference next week will call for urgent action, seeking agreement on a target for reducing deaths from air pollution.
                    WHO and partners such as UN Environment are developing ways to support countries. For example, WHO is developing a toolkit (the Clean Household Energy Solutions Toolkit, CHEST) to help countries implement WHO’s recommendations on household fuel combustion and to develop policies to expand clean household energy use.
                    BreatheLife – a global campaign for clean air,  headed by WHO, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, and UN Environment – is mobilizing communities to reduce the impact of air pollution in cities, regions and countries, currently reaching around 97 million people.
                    Clean air interventions will be a focus of the conference. Affordable strategies exist to reduce emissions from energy, transport, waste management, housing and industrial sectors. These interventions often carry other benefits like reduced traffic and noise, increased physical activity and better land use – all of which contribute to improving health and well-being. The conference will present activities and results from the ongoing work of the WHO’s Urban Health Initiative focused on supporting cities with the data, tools and capacity to select, implement and track ‘clean and healthy’ policies at the city level.  Better air quality will benefit all of us, everywhere.
