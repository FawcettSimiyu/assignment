                <ol>
                    <li>Use Public Transportation: Use your vehicle a lot less often. Carpool and rideshare when you have the ability to do so and consider using public transportation instead of walking; that way, you aren’t contributing to all of the issues that the air is already dealing with before adding your car to the mix.</li>
                    <li>Plant a Garden: Plant a garden that is going to give the air the nutrients that it needs to be cleaner. There are so many plants out there that will eat up the junk in the atmosphere. Do your research and see what one(s) you can grow easily and that will help the world around you.</li>
                    <li>Turn Off Lights When not in Use: Don’t keep the lights or other electric devices on. The more traditional power that you are using, the more energy you’re wasting and the more that you’re polluting the air.</li>
                    <li>Choose Products With Minimal Packaging: When it comes to buying items from outside, consider buying those with minimal packaging and are reusable. Even if they are packaged, try to buy the one with least packaging.</li>
                    <li>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Recycle as much as you can so that it can be reused later on in other products. That way, you aren’t adding to the problem by adding additional products to the mix of what is going on.</li>
                </ol>
